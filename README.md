# bankruptcy-related-news-for-traders

This is to help traders track companies that just filed for bankruptcy / chapter 11 so they don't miss on the opportunity to make over 100%+ in less than a week.

Chapter 11 plays are almost always multi-baggers. Some of them did over 1000% in 2021 (eg HTZ), and the most recent did 300%+ (ENJY).

I alerted ENJY in my chatroom on Discord on July 1st. It went up 300% on Tuesday/Wednesday after the long week.

There are different ways to track banpruptcy plays, and this is just 1 of them.
